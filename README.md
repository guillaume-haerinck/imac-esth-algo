# IMAC Algorithmic Thinking

(De)(Re)Coding Frieder Nake - Walkthrough Raster (Series 2)

## Original artwork analysis

The original work is made of straight black lines on a white background. They can be both vertical and horizontal, but not oblique.

A few constraints seems to have been made to get the final result :
- The length of vertical lines is not linear, but is by step. The real multiplication of an fixed height.
- The horizontal line width is fixed, and it is the same width as the gap beetween vertical lines.
- The final shape fit inside a square.
- The length and the chance to spawn lines depends on the area of the square. The chance inside the areas of the square are randomized, but can reproduce a shape (oblique line, a circle...).
